## Recommendation system based on a graph

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate movie recommender system based on user tastes and to be able to explain its decisions.

## Data sets 

MovieLens : https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

## Graph Structure

The graph stores the list of all User Nodes (and Movie Nodes for the movieLens dataset). Edges are stored within the nodes themselves, making it practical to get information about degree or average rating.
